Python-XML-Parser
=================

Provides a wrapper API for the XML parsing included with Python

xmlparse.py is a wrapper for the standard "xml" Python library. It provides a simple way to parse XML data or source file.

Another main feature is the XMLStructure class. This is automatically instantiated for each XMLParser instance.
With the XMLStructure class, a dictionary representation is created for the XML. This is recursively created, so the XML can have as many "levels" as needed.
